A flex container expands items to fill available free space, or shrinks them to prevent overflow.

The justify-content property aligns the flexible container's items when the items do not use all available space on the main-axis (horizontally).

    Use the content property to specify the content to insert.
    Use the ::after selector to insert something after the content.
